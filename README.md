Autonomous Robot Car Using Arduino

This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an autonomous robot car using Arduino. The system integrates multiple sensors and control algorithms to perform line following, distance measurement, obstacle detection, and orientation sensing.

Project Objectives

Develop a robot car capable of autonomous navigation

Measure travelled distance using a rotary encoder

Detect obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor

Sense orientation and angular motion using an IMU

Improve line-following performance using PID control

System Features

Line Following using three IR sensors with PID control

Distance Measurement using an encoder with interrupt-based counting

Obstacle Detection using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
